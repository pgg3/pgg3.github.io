I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the CS Department at City University of Hong Kong, advised by [Prof. Qingfu Zhang](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~qzhan7/index.html) (Chair Professor, IEEE Fellow).

My research focuses on computational intelligence approaches to build advanced AI systems. Specifically, I develop evolutionary computation methods and machine learning algorithms for solving complex optimization problems in real-world applications.

**Research Interests:**
- Evolutionary Computation & Multi-objective Optimization
- Adversarial Machine Learning & Robustness
- Large Language Models for Algorithm Design
- Computational Intelligence Applications

Throughout my academic journey, I have had the privilege of collaborating with distinguished researchers: [Prof. Qingchuan Zhao](https://bruceqczhao.github.io/), [Dr. Xi Lin](https://xi-l.github.io/), and [Mr. Cheng Gong](https://chenggong1995.github.io/cg.io/).

I serve as a reviewer for top-tier conferences including **NIPS**, **ICML**, **ICLR**, **AISTATS**, and **CEC**, as well as journals such as **Swarm and Evolutionary Computation** and **Evolutionary Computation**.
